            This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred
            to in this Terms of Use as the “Arbitration Agreement.” You agree
            that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise
            between you and Turbostart, whether arising out of or relating to
            this Terms of Use (including any alleged breach thereof), the Site,
            any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions
            between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding
            arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of
            this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual
            claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this
            Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to
            the attention of any court of law, or local agencies, and such
            agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your
            behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Terms of Use, you and
            Turbostart are each waiving the right to participate in a claim in
            any court of law. Your rights will be determined by a neutral
            arbitrator, nor a judge. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act ,1996
            governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration
            Agreement.

            UNLESS BOTH YOU AND TURBOSTART AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY

            Turbostart is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and
            efficiently, and most user concerns can be resolved quickly and to
            the user’s satisfaction by emailing us at legal@turbostart.co If
            such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek
            arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a
            written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Turbostart
            should be sent to Turbostart Global Events LLP, 36, Infantry Road,
            Sampangi, Tasker Town, Shivaji Nagar, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560001
            (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and
            basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief
            sought. If Turbostart and you do not resolve the claim within sixty
            (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Turbostart
            may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the
            amount of any settlement offer made by Turbostart or you shall not
            be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines
            the amount, if any, to which you or Turbostart is entitled.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.subtitleStyle}>Arbitration Procedures</p>
          <p className={styles.mainDescription}>
            Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance
            with the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 and any rules and
            procedures thereof (collectively, the “Arbitration Act”), as
            modified by this Arbitration Agreement. If there is any
            inconsistency between any term of the Arbitration Act or Rules and
            any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this
            Arbitration Agreement will preside, provided that the application of
            this Arbitration Agreement does not expressly contradict the
            Arbitration Act. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of
            these Terms of Use as a court would. All issues are for the
            arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating
            to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration
            Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and
            more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the
            arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual
            basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms of Use
            and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in
            court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited
            reasons.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.mainDescription}>
            Unless Turbostart and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings
            will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties
            with due consideration of their ability to travel and other
            pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a
            location, the determination shall be made by arbitrator. Regardless
            of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator
            shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the
            essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.subtitleStyle}>Costs of Arbitration</p>
          <p className={styles.mainDescription}>
            Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees
            (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the
            Arbitration Act and applicable rules thereof, unless otherwise
            provided in this Arbitration Agreement.

          <p className={styles.subtitleStyle}>Confidentiality</p>
          <p className={styles.mainDescription}>

            If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of

            and Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable,
            the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or
            provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
            expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
            provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so

            Representative Claims in any Court of Law and Non-Individualized

            accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use).

            remove and discard any content within the Site, for any reason,

            letter or spirit of these Terms of Use. Any suspected fraudulent,
            abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of
            your use of Site, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement
            authorities. Turbostart may also in its sole discretion and at any
            time discontinue providing the Site, or any part thereof, with or
            without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the
            Site under any provision of this Terms of Use may be effected
            without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Turbostart may

            These Terms of Use will be governed by the laws of India without

            you and Turbostart agree to submit to the personal and exclusive
            jurisdiction of the courts located within Bangalore, Karnataka. The
            failure of Turbostart to exercise or enforce any right or provision
            of these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of such right or
            provision. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a
            court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties
            nevertheless agree that the court should endeavour to give effect to
            the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other
            provisions of these Terms of Use remain in full force and effect.
            You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any
            claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the
            Site or these Terms of Use must be filed within one (1) year after

            Turbostart, but Turbostart may assign or transfer this Terms of Use,
            in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in
            these Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or
